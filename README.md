# JavaJ2EE
Java Web Apps created using Eclipse Mars IDE for WEBD 3102 at NSCC fall 2015

This repo contains a single independent project implementing all the J2EE techniques learned
over the term.  The included word document summarizes the project, and includes a one-line
description of each Servlet, Filter, and model class.

The web-application has limited styling, but functions as a web-store, with a cart and browse
system for customers, and administrative features for staff.  For users, it includes browsing
stock by book or by author, updating your own profile info, and using a cart system to make
orders and see your own order status.  For administrators, the application allows monitoring
and updating of inventory items or current orders.

The application makes extensive use of Servlets and Filters, and views are managed via
"Expression Language" and JSP tag libraries.  The application is functional if hooked up to
an Apache Server.
